# I've joined the #100DaysOfCode Challenge

I'm working on #100DaysOfCode alongside some pals from [Code Like A Girl](https://www.codelikeagirl.org) starting April 6, 2020. We're all working on our own projects but checking in and talking about our progress regularly.

I'm doing a unit at uni on mobile application development so my project(s) for the 100 days is simply to work on something for that every day, whether it's one of the assigned tasks, the final project, or related tutorials and exercises. 

[Here's my log](https://github.com/doubleedesign/100-days-of-code/blob/master/r1-log.md).
